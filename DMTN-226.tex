\section{Background}

During steady-state operations, Rubin Observatory's LSST will produce about ten million world-public alerts of transients, variable, and moving objects.
Science users will work with community alert brokers to crossmatch, filter, and classify these alerts in order to identify the subset that require real-time followup observations.
At the time the vision for this ambitious and comprehensive alert system was developed, no community alert brokers were functional.
Accordingly, the Rubin project provided a fallback: a simple ``alert filtering system'' (AFS; \S \ref{sec:requirements}) that the project would provide.
The AFS would allow Rubin data-rights holders to apply simple user-defined or pre-defined filters to the Rubin alert stream.
This minimized the risk that community alert brokers would not be available, or not provide the functionality required to fulfill users' needs.

Today, the sitution is quite different.
Seven community alert brokers\footnote{\url{https://www.lsst.org/scientists/alert-brokers}} have been approved for direct access to the full Rubin alert stream, with two more planning to operate downstream of a full-stream broker.
The brokers have mature systems and active user bases and are operating on live Zwicky Transient Facility alerts.
Several brokers have functionality which mirrors that planned for the Rubin AFS.
Accordingly, the rationale for a project-provided AFS is less clear.

However, it is reasonable for the Rubin project to ensure that Rubin data-rights holders have access to AFS-like capabilities throughout the survey, even if that service is provided by another entity.
In this technote we propose a partnership with the ANTARES alert broker \citep{2021AJ....161..107M}, one of the seven approved full-stream brokers. 
Like the Rubin Operations project, ANTARES operates as part of NOIRLab.

In \S \ref{sec:requirements} we review the formal requirements for the Rubin AFS.
\S \ref{sec:antares} describes the ANTARES alert broker.
In \S \ref{sec:implementation} we discuss steps necessary to allow ANTARES to supply AFS functionality to the Rubin data rights community.

\section{Rubin Requirements for Alert Filtering} \label{sec:requirements}

The top-level Science Requirements Document \citedsp{LPM-17} describes the AFS in narrative language:
%
\begin{quote}
The users will have an option of a query-like pre-filtering of this data stream in order to select likely candidates for specific transient type...
Several pre-defined filters optimized for traditionally popular transients, such as supernovae and microlensed sources, will
also be available, as well as the ability to add new pre-defined filters as the survey continues.
\end{quote}

This is followed down into formal requirements as follows.

LSR, \citedsp{LSE-29}:

\textbf{LSR-REQ-0025 is supposed to be related but seems to be broken in current LSR}

\begin{quote}
Pre-defined filters optimized for traditionally popular transients shall be made available. 
It shall be possible for the project to add new pre-defined filters as the survey progresses.
\lsrreq{0026}
\end{quote}

% nothing in OSS

DMSR, \citedsp{LSE-61}:

\begin{quote}
A basic, limited capacity, alert filtering service shall be provided that can be given user defined filters to reduce the alert stream to manageable levels.
\dmreq{0342}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Users of the LSST Alert Filtering Service shall be able to use a predefined set of simple filters.
\dmreq{0348}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The LSST alert filtering service shall support \texttt{numBrokerUsers} (20) simultaneous
users with each user allocated a bandwidth capable of receiving the equivalent of
\texttt{numBrokerAlerts} (100) alerts per visit.
\dmreq{0343}
\end{quote}

Finally, the DPDD \citedsp{LSE-163} provides a narrative description of the expected functionality from an end-user perspective.

\begin{quote}
To directly serve the end-users, LSST will provide a basic, limited capacity, alert filtering service. 
This service will run at the LSST U.S. Archive Center (at NCSA). It will let astronomers create simple filters that limit what alerts are ultimately forwarded to them. 
These user defined
filters will be possible to specify using an SQL-like declarative language, or short snippets of
(likely Python) code. 
For example, here's what a filter may look like:
\textit{Code snippet removed}

We emphasize that this LSST-provided capability will be limited, and is not intended to satisfy the wide variety of use cases that a full-fledged public Event Broker could. 
For example, we do not plan to provide any exclusive classification to a unique category of object. 
Following the SRD specification, however, we will provide a limited number of pre-defined filters for a small number of object types of common interest. 
These will answer non-exclusive questions 
such as “is the light curve consistent with an RR Lyra?”, and will have potentially highly overlapping selections, designed to provide good completeness but perhaps only very modest purity.
No information beyond what is contained in the VOEvent packet will be available to the pre-defined or user-defined filters (e.g., no cross-matches to other catalogs). 
The complexity and
run time of user defined filters will be limited by available resources. 
Execution latency will
not be guaranteed. 
The number of VOEvents transmitted to each user per visit will be limited as well (e.g., the equivalent of 20 full-size alert packets per visit per user, dynamically throttled depending on load). 
Finally, the total number of simultaneous subscribers is likely to be limited---in case of overwhelming interest, a TAC-like proposal process may be instituted. 
\end{quote}

Implicit in the discussion above is that the AFS should be broadly useful the widest potential range of alert-driven science.
Additionally, consistent with the Rubin Data Policy \citedsp{RDO-013}, the AFS should be accessible to any Rubin Data Rights holder.
While the alert data itself is world-public, access to Rubin-hosted services like the AFS is restricted to Data Rights holders.
However, there is no restriction on third parties offering similar filtering services.
